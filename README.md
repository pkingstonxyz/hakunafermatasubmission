## Brainstorming

Songs that Inspire

1. Regina Caeli - Patrick Lenk
   - I enjoy this one because it has lyrics that I can mostly understand or otherwise piece together vague meanings from even though my latin really isn't that good.
   - The thing this reminds me of is singing and performing pieces in my HS choir. We didn't do that many latin pieces, but latin and other ecclesial songs are inescapable in a choral environment.
   - It's helpful specifically when I'm studing latin as I like to mentally separate Latin and Greek. 
2. Εξομολογείσθε - Χορός Αγιορετών Πατέρων
   - I enjoy the bells in this song and that's really it.
   - This one is more evocative for me, and it's specifically evocative of my time in greece. I look back on my time in Greece with essentially only fondness.
   - It's helpful because it's in greek, so when I study greek I listen to greek music. 
3. The Angel and the One - Weezer
   - I enjoy this song because of its place in Weezer's discography (It's like a top 5 weezer song but it's on one of the worst albums), and I also like it because of its place in the life story of Rivers Cuomo.
   - It doesn't really remind me of any particular moment, but the religious undertones are cool, and it was written by Pat Wilson who shares my name so it reminds me of myself :)
   - It's helpful because there's not a lot of lyrics, and the lyrics that are there aren't super intrusive.

My musical idea: A dialup internet handshake

**My inspiration songs were largely a latin song and a greek song. I thought about doing something with greek modes and tetrachords over a public domain jazz standard, but instead I am going with analogy, Latin songs while studying latin, Greek while greek, and so computer while computers.**

There are several recognizable parts and luckily they're broken up based on a standard. Based on [this](https://oona.windytan.com/posters/dialup-final.png) diagram I'll be going with dial tones, dialing the number(DTMF), the network interaction, and the phase 3 in this image (equalizer and echo transfer).

I think the conversational aspect of it can be played with so my plan is:

 - Dial tone -> Drone throughout the piece.
 - Dialing the number -> The tones being played for each number can be used to represent a melody.
 - Network interaction -> Counter melody/second instrument.
 - Equalizer and echo transfer -> I think having some ongoing noise in the background could be good.

I don't plan on actually sampling any actual dialup modem interactions because they sound kind of ugly I think.
